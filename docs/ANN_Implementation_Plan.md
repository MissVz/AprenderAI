# ANN Implementation Plan

## Objective
Enhance the AI-powered adaptive quiz by integrating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict and personalize learning paths.

## Expected Inputs
- User quiz logs (`quiz_logs.db`)
- User accuracy trends (`visualize_quiz_progress.py` output)
- Features: number of attempts, accuracy rate, question type

## Expected Outputs
- Predicted next difficulty level
- Recommended vocabulary categories for improvement

## Next Steps
1. Extract quiz log data and preprocess for ANN training.
2. Implement ANN model in `backend/ann_model.py`.
3. Integrate ANN predictions into FastAPI (`backend/main.py`).
4. Validate predictions against actual user performance.
